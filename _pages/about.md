I am a graduate student @ [Euston Lab](https://www.eustonlab.ca/) in
[Canadian Centre for Behavioral Neuroscience](https://www.ulethbridge.ca/research/centres-institutes/canadian-centre-behavioural-neuroscience)
`(CCBN)`, [University of Lethbridge](https://www.ulethbridge.ca/)
currently investigating the memory-guided decision making dynamics within the
medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus through descriptive modeling of neural
electrophysiology and normative modeling employing deep reinforcement learning.

As a transdisciplinary neuroscientist in the making, I’m deeply interested in
all aspects of brain sciences, particularly abstract representational learning
and decision making.

I was previously a Post Baccalaureate Research Assistant at
[Swanand lab](https://swanandlab.github.io/) in [Centre for Neuroscience, Indian
Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://cns.iisc.ac.in/) working on quantifying
plasticity of astrocytes due to stress and its pharmacological treatment through
bioimage analysis. Prior to this, I pursued my undergraduate studies in Computer
Engineering at [Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya, Indore](https://ietdavv.edu.in/).
