I'm a graduate student @ Euston Lab in <a href='https://www.ulethbridge.ca/research/centres-institutes/canadian-centre-behavioural-neuroscience'>Canadian Centre for Behavioral Neuroscience</a>
`(CCBN)`, <a href='https://www.ulethbridge.ca/'>University of Lethbridge</a>
solving problems in neuroscience of decision making through neural data
analysis, reinforcement learning, & computational modeling.

As a scientist, I’m deeply interested in all aspects of brain research.

I was previously a Post Baccalaureate Research Assistant in Centre for Neuroscience, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore working on quantifying plasticity of astrocytes due to stress and its pharmacological treatment through bioimage analysis. And before that I did my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering in Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya, Indore.
