Semi-supervised morphological analysis of confocal microscopic tissue images containing immunostained cells of elaborate morphology. The pipeline crops out individual cells from tissue images, and extracts morphometric features out of each cell via Sholl analysis. These features are further used to perform classification and analyze their spatial relevance as a function of the organism's phenotype or pharmacology.
